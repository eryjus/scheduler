# Century Scheduler (A Purpose-Built Test)

This project is a purpose-built test to figure out how to write a scheduler.  What prompted this is the difficulty I am having with [Century-OS](https://github.com/eryjus/century-os) getting the scheduler to work properly.

I am using [Brendan's Multi-Tasking Tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Brendan's_Multi-tasking_Tutorial) as a guide here.

This code is built from the ground up.  There is no base starting point and just the minimum is used to get the scheduler up and running -- protected mode only.

As usual, I will be using `make` backed by `tup`.  See the Century-OS commentary (or many of my other projects for that matter) for more information.
